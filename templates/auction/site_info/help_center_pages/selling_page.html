                            All products are being sold by "The Pop Up." We want to ensure that everything sold is
                            authentic, and the best weay to do that is by controlling what gets bought and sold. We only
                            secure product from manufacturers and trusted retailers, and we keep the receipts to prove
                            it. We believe that if youâ€™re going to pay top dollar for your favorite pair kicks or
                            clothing item, it shoud be the authentic product.
