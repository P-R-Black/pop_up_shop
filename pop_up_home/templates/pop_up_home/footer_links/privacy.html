                <p> The Pop Up (The Pop Up) values its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") will help you
                    understand how we collect and use personal information from those who visit our website or make use
                    of our online facilities and services, and what we will and will not do with the information we
                    collect. Our Policy has been designed and created to ensure those affiliated with The Pop Up of
                    our commitment and realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to exceed, most existing
                    privacy standards.

                    point in time The Pop Up decides to make use of any personally identifiable information on file,
                    in a manner vastly different from that which was stated when this information was initially
                    collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have the
                    option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner..
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Policy applies to The Pop Up, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that
                    The Pop Up does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a
                    website that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site
                    with information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you review the privacy policies and
                    statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in which
                    websites garner, make use of and share the information collected.
                </p>
                <p>Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the following</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our website;</li>

                <h4 class="bold section_title">Information We Collect</h4>
                <p>
                    It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if
                    you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any
                    products or services. This website collects various types of information, such as:
                </p>
                <ol class="indented">
                    <li>
                        Information automatically collected when visiting our website, which may include cookies, third
                        party tracking technologies and server logs.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>

                    information, such as age, gender, household income, political affiliation, race and religion, as
                    well as the type of browser you are using, IP address, or type of operating system, which will
                    assist us in providing and maintaining superior quality service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Pop Up may also deem it necessary, from time to time, to follow websites that our users may
                    frequent to gleam what types of services and products may be the most popular to customers or the
                    general public.
                </p>
                <h4 class="bold section_title">Why We Collect Information and For How Long</h4>
                <p>We are collecting your data for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To better understand your needs and provide you with the services you have requested;</li>
                    <li>To fulfill our legitimate interest in improving our services and products;</li>
                    <li>To send you promotional emails containing information we think you may like when we have your
                        consent to do so;</li>
                    <li>To contact you to fill out surveys or participate in other types of market research, when we
                        have your consent to do so;</li>
                    <li>To customize our website according to your online behavior and personal preferences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The data we collect from you will be stored for no longer than necessary. The length of time we
                    retain said information will be determined based upon the following criteria: the length of time
                    your personal information remains relevant; the length of time it is reasonable to keep records to
                    demonstrate that we have fulfilled our duties and obligations; any limitation periods within which
                    claims might be made; any retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators,
                    professional bodies or associations; the type of contract we have with you, the existence of your
                    consent, and our legitimate interest in keeping such information as stated in this Policy.
                </p>
                <h4 class="bold section_title">Use of Information Collected</h4>

                    website and to ensure delivery of the services you need and request. At times, we may find it
                    necessary to use personally identifiable information as a means to keep you informed of other

                <h4 class="bold section_title">Links to Other Websites</h4>
                <p>
                    Our website does contain links to affiliate and other websites. The Pop Up does not claim nor
                    accept responsibility for any privacy policies, practices and/or procedures of other such websites.
                    Therefore, we encourage all users and visitors to be aware when they leave our website and to read
                    the privacy statements of every website that collects personally identifiable information. This
                    Privacy Policy Agreement applies only and solely to the information collected by our website.
                </p>
                <h4 class="bold section_title">Notice to European Union Users</h4>
                <p>
                    The Pop Up's operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to
                    us, the information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United
                    States. (The adequacy decision on the EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This
                    framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to
                    the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free transfer of data to companies that are
                    certified in the US under the Privacy Shield.) By providing personal information to us, you are
                    consenting to its storage and use as described in this Policy.
                </p>
                <h4 class="bold section_title">Security</h4>
                <p>
                    The Pop Up takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information
                    via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect
                    sensitive information (e.g. credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted
                    to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking
                    for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your
                    information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
                    billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
                    computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure
                    environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or
                    modification of the user's personal information under our control.
                </p>
